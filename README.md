# Deep learning for Fashionistas: African Attire Detection

Link to project article:

## Problem Statement

Especially in Africa, cultures are being lost to civilization and technology. This has brought up this project idea to try to preserve these cultures and what other way than to have AI do the job!

Smart systems can be developed including Chatbots, image identifiers, and text-to-speech to help combat culture loss and help preserve our heritages.

We will are building a model to help classify eight local African attires in countries including Nigeria and South Africa.. Preserving this kind of model will help foreigners and the next generation to easily identify their cultural artifacts.

## Approach
Deep learning algorithm is used to classify 8 African attires. The backend framework is TensorFlow. The IDE is Colab, and the accuracy is open to further improvement.

## Dataset Description
The dataset of images of African attires was gathered from the internet using the Google Chrome extension to scrape the web.
*  It contains images belonging to 8 classes.
*  The directory has 9784 images belonging to 8 classes for training and,
*  2579 files belonging to 8 classes for validation of the model.
*  The dataset consists of a total of 12,363 images containing 8 classes.
*  The classes are tribes in Africa which are:
      *  Adire (from Nigeria)
      *  Idgo (from Nigeria)
      *  Idoma (from Nigeria)
      *  Igala (from Nigeria)
      *  Tiv (from Nigeria)
      *  Tswana-Shweshwe (from South Africa)
      *  Xhosa-South Africa (from South Africa)
      *  Zulu (from South Africa)
